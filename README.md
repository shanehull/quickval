## WIP

A work-in-progress, interactive CLI tool that uses the free [QuickFS.net API](https://quickfs.net/features/public-api) to step through security valuations.

It supports the following traditional valuation models:

- DCF Growth-Exit Model
- DCF Two-Stage (Perpetual) Growth Model
- Dividend Discount Model (Two-Stage)

Like any valuation model that aims to predict future business prospects, it is not meant to be construed as an accurate representation of future value.

It is meant to be a yard-stick measure of exactly the inputs given, which are a representation of the history at best, and not a representation of future value.

If you would like to determine the true value of a company, you'd be better off purchasing Elon's new time machine cyber-truck thing - that's what it does right?
